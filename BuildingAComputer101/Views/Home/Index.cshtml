        <li>
            Research and plan your PC build. Start by choosing between AMD and Intel processors, considering factors like performance, power consumption, budget, and compatibility. Check out the latest offerings from each brand, such as the Ryzen series from AMD and the Core series from Intel.

        <li>
            Select a budget-friendly motherboard that complements your chosen CPU. For AMD processors, consider options like the AMD B450, B550, or X570 chipset motherboards. If you prefer Intel, look into motherboards with Intel H310 or B360 chipset. Ensure compatibility with other components and consider features you need, such as Wi-Fi support.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose your desired components, including the GPU, RAM, storage, etc. Pay attention to compatibility between the components. For example, if you select an AMD Ryzen 3900XT CPU, you'll need DDR4 RAM. However, if you plan to use upcoming Ryzen 7000 processors, you must use DDR5 RAM, and your motherboard should support this.
